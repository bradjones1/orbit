I'm excited to announce a complete refresh of Orbitjs.com! üéâ

Our site has been rebuilt using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). The
source for this site now lives in [Orbit's
monorepo](https://github.com/orbitjs/orbit/tree/main/website) right alongside
the packages that it describes. This will make it easier to update docs along
with code, preferably even in the same PRs.

I'm especially excited to announce that we are finally publishing API reference
docs, generated with [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/), alongside the Orbit
guides. The first API docs available are for the upcoming v0.17, which can be
accessed directly [here](/docs/api/index.md) or by choosing `Next` from the
documentation version selector in the upper right.

While the current API docs are much better than nothing, the prose and examples
are pretty thin for most packages. Please be patient as we work to fill out
these docs through improved code annotations. Community contributions are
encouraged and most welcome! ‚ù§Ô∏è
